# CamViewer

A super simple GUI that uses the VLC libraries to display (up to) 6 RTSP camera streams.

CamViewer is dependent on the following NuGet packages:

* LibVLCSharp 3.7.0
* LibVLCSharp.WinForms 3.7.0
* VideoLAN.LibVLC.Windows 3.0.18

Version numbers at the time of writing are shown, but future versions are probably drop-in replacements.
